            <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Volt (VLT) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency built from scratch using the Rust programming language.
                It aims to provide a secure, decentralized, and efficient medium of exchange without the legacy overhead of older blockchains.
                By leveraging Rust's memory safety and performance, Volt offers a modern alternative for miners and users alike.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The cryptocurrency landscape is dominated by forks of Bitcoin and Ethereum. While robust, these codebases carry over a decade of technical debt.
                Volt was conceived as a clean-slate implementation, optimizing for the modern multi-core era while retaining the proven "Nakamoto Consensus" model.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Technical Architecture</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Core Language</h3>
            <p>
                Volt is written entirely in **Rust**, ensuring memory safety without garbage collection.
                This results in a lighter daemon footprint and higher resistance to buffer overflow attacks compared to C++ implementations.
            </p>
            <h3>3.2 Consensus Mechanism</h3>
            <p>
                Volt utilizes **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** with the **SHA-256d** algorithm (Double SHA-256).
                This ensures compatibility with existing mining hardware (ASICs) and software infrastructures, promoting immediate network security.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Economic Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ticker:</strong> VLT</li>
                <li><strong>Max Supply:</strong> 21,000,000 VLT</li>
                <li><strong>Block Time:</strong> 60 Seconds</li>
                <li><strong>Block Reward:</strong> 50 VLT</li>
                <li><strong>Halving Interval:</strong> 105,000 Blocks (Approx. 2 Years)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The emission curve mimics Bitcoin's disinflationary model, ensuring VLT becomes scarcer over time.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Network Security</h2>
            <p>
                The difficulty adjustment algorithm retargets every 10 blocks to maintain a stable 60-second block generation time.
                Transactions are secured using Secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Volt represents a return to fundamentals—simple, secure, and decentralized money—built with the tools of the future.
